*AcDisplay brings a piece of Motorola's Active Display to your device.*

Using this app, you will see notifications light up your screen as they arrive and show as a circular icon with a timer ring, which is your chance to act on that notification before your screen times back out. If you’d like to act on the most recent notification, you can swipe up and into it. If you’d like to simply unlock your phone, you can do that by swiping down. Designed to be light on resources, battery and frustration, AcDisplay is the perfect companion for you.
