    How can I uninstall this app?
</b><br/>
Go to Settings > Security > Device Administrators and <a href="acdisplay://remove_admin_access">disable</a> AcDisplay.
You can now <a href="acdisplay://uninstall">uninstall</a> AcDisplay normally.
<br/><br/>

    How to dismiss the permanent notifications of active mode or the lockscreen?
</b><br/>
The notification is necessary to ensure AcDisplay isn't killed by the system.
However, to hide it safely (sending test notification won't function anymore!) <a
        href="acdisplay://launch_app_info">launch app info</a> and disable showing notifications.
<br/><br/>

<b>
    When the secure lockscreen (pattern or PIN) will be implemented?
</b><br/>
This is not possible to create a custom secure lockscreen for Android.
The other apps that have this feature are only pretending to be secure, but in real world there's always a way to bypass them.
